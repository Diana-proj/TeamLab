Emotion Recognition:

Baseline method: SVM? NN? LG?, choose two
numpy? panda? nltk?
-data preprocessing
-feature extraction(tf-idf)
-training
-hyperparameter tuning
-evaluation(F-score)

Advanced method: is it preferred to use new techniques?(use BERT for embeddings, make model more edvanced using buildt-in libs)
or to extend analysis?(for example use BERT to understand the meaning(topic) of the text)
-feature extraction(BERT)
-training(use build-in libs)
-hyperparameter tuning
-evaluation(F-score)
