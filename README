Emotion Recognition:

Baseline method: SVM? LG?
numpy panda but dont use built in F-score
-data preprocessing
-feature extraction(tf-idf)
-training
-hyperparameter tuning
-evaluation script(F-score):
  -need F-score for labels and whole set

Advanced method: is it preferred to use new techniques?(use BERT for embeddings, make model more edvanced using buildt-in libs)
or to extend analysis?(for example use BERT to understand the meaning(topic) of the text), 
could try a different classifier, 
could try to explain by 1 label predicted better or worse and make it better
-feature extraction(BERT)
-training(use build-in libs)
-hyperparameter tuning
-evaluation(F-score)
